News App Project
The application connects to the internet and fetches news from the New York Times API using HttpURLConnection, which is then parsed using a custom built JSON parser. The parsed information is then presented as a news feed in namely four categories - Tech, Science, Travel, and Books. The splash screen presents these categories with a help of a tabbed layout and viewpager, thereby doing away with additional screens and making it easier for the user to access any news category with just a finger swipe.

Objective
The goal is to create a News feed app that provides regularly updated news from the internet.
